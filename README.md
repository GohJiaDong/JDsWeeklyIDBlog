# JDsWeeklyIDBlog
Week 1
I've learnt the basic elements that makes a website good and also learnt to apply them by making a simple recipe blog html site

Week 2
I've learnt class and id attributes that can be applied to html, which enable further customizationof my html site using css. This week's lesson also focused more on the aesthetics of html for both viewers and site creators. For instance, there are proper "labels" such as headers, navs and sections.
 
Week 3
This week's lesson focused on going a bit more in depth of the use of css, such as the use of selectors, positioning and most interestingly, input fields. Casading and specificity are also very interesting as it teaches me how to use css better. Wireframe is also introduced to help myself solify ideas for my html sites. Flex display was also introduced to enable responsive designs on our webpage.

Week 4
The lesson this week continues to focus on the use of flexboxes on images and texts.

Week 5
For this week's async lesson, Javascript was introduced to expose us to deeper interactions with CSS and HTML. My biggest takeaway was the DOM, which enabled changes to the webpage on the fly which is very interesting and it is the most easy to understand.
