        <h1>Week 2 ID class Blog</h1>
        <p>
            I've learnt class and id attributes that can be applied to html, which enable further customization
            of my html site using css. This week's lesson also focused more on the aesthetics of html for both viewers
            and site creators. For instance, there are proper "labels" such as headers, navs and sections.
