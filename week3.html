            This week's lesson focused on going a bit more in depth of the use of css, such as the use of 
            selectors, positioning and most interestingly, input fields. Casading and specificity are also 
            very interesting as it teaches me how to use css better. Wireframe is also introduced to help myself
            solify ideas for my html sites.
